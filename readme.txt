The problem is to implement a search engine in Java that implements the defined 
interfaces provided in the project files. The typical usage is to first create 
index. After creating the index, search queries can be issued, which 
return results related to the searches. Search results include the name of 
the document where the search term was found, the number of occurrences 
of the search term within each document, etc.

Example files are given in the docs directory included as part of the project. 
All files are assumed to have a size of less than 1M, and do not contain markup.
