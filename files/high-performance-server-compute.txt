High performance server compute

The Nutanix platform includes up to four individual server nodes housed in a space-efficient, 2U rack-mountable appliance. Each server node is equipped with best-in-class Intel processors and high-speed memory for the most demanding workloads.

You can add additional Nutanix appliances to an existing cluster to scale performance and capacity. Or, small clusters can be combined with larger clusters to streamline administration.

Virtualization hypervisors are pre-installed, ready for the rapid deployment of virtual machines (VMs). Each node can support just one or up to 100 virtual desktops.

To optimize performance further, the Nutanix solution manages storage resources in tiers. The data requested most frequently, the “hot” data, moves to the highest-performance tier, which uses the PCIe SSD. Unlike competing solutions, this PCIe-based flash tier serves as a true persistent tier, not simply a cache.

Heat-optimized tiering (HOT) ensures the highest performance for both write and read operations. When a piece of data is accessed less frequently, the Nutanix software moves the data to a lower-cost, higher-capacity storage medium such as SATA-HDDs.
